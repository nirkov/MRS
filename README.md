# MovieRentalService
The project includes two implementation (Java) of servers: Reactor and TPC.
I built a movie rental system based on these patterns, and I established communication
between the server (Java) and clients (C++).
I learned from this project about TCP, working with server and protocols in general, and I also
learned to work with the GSON library when Json file was the database I maintained.
